# About the project

Showtracker is a program that helps you keep track of your watched shows and movies.
It also allows you to save series/movies to a list and offers functionality for giving the movie/show a personal rating.

The program itself is written in Java and the GUI is written in Swing. The application has five main sections, one for viewing your personal profile,
one for viewing the lists of series that you have saved, and one for viewing the list of movies you have saved, a home screen in which you can quickly mark an 
episode as seen from your lists of series, and a search section where you can search for series/ movies to add to your lists. 

Showtracker also has functionality for declaring how much you have seen of a specific movie, give personal ratings to a show/movie, mark a specific season as seen
and more!
